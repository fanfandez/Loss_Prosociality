This repository contains raw data pertaining to:

Zhang, Y., Zhai, Y., Zhou, X., Zhang, Z., Gu, R., Luo, Y., & Feng, C. (2022). Loss context enhances preferences for generosity but reduces preferences for honesty: Evidence from a combined behavioural‐computational approach. European Journal of Social Psychology, 00, 1–12. https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2896

All data used to perform analyses from the paper are in the loss_prosociality_data.csv

1. subjID = the number of participants, range from 1 to 96
2. condA = 1/2, 1 means the dictator game (DG) and 2 means the message game (MG)
3. condB = 1/2, 1 means the loss context and 2 means the gain context

Thus, we totally have four conditions: DG_loss, DG_gain, MG_loss, MG_gain

4. t = the number of trial of each condition, range from 1 to 12
5. Ms_ad = money for self of the advantage option, the advantage option means Ms_ad > Mo_ad
6. Mo_ad = money for other of the advantage option
7. Ms_disad = money for self of the disadvantage option, the disadvantage option means Ms_disad < Mo_disad
8. Mo_disad = money for other of the disadvantage option
9. decision = 1/2, 1 means participant chose the advantage option, 2 means participant chose the disadvantage option
